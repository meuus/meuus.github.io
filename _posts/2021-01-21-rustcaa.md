Scientific computing means or at least implies that the targeted applications are solvable on the fatest computer system avaiable now and possibly tomorrow. In the field of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) the simulation easily uses the computational domain consisting of billions of meshes. The demands of multi-physics multi-scale solutios increases complexity of governining equations and the numerical models. With rising of new paradigms in IT (information technologies) the scientific simulations have adopted artificial intelligence (AI) in its main topics. The CFD applications also use the AI-based analysis, e.g., flow control and optimization problems.

For a long time, however, the code implementation has been done with FORTRAN or C languages. It is also on-going truth in the most of the CFD engineering. Of course, the fundamental basis of the CFD must be built on the robust accurate numerical methods formulated with the stable libdaries. However, at the beginning of the software engineering (at least for the CFD) far more enthusiastic efforts were the main thrust to realize the current advancement in the various technologies. Furthermore, the coupling of new software libdaries could be realized with the new concepts in the modern programming langauges. [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/ "Rust Programming Language") is one designed for performance and memory safety. An easy effort for a couple of hours can show a better performance than time-consuming __Python__ even with _numpy_ arrays.

Flux calculation in __Python__ code

```python
def CalculateRHS(self):
    ...
    self.DQ[0,:,:,3:-3] =
          self.ACoeff[1]*self.E[:,:,4:-2]
        + self.ACoeff[2]*self.E[:,:,5:-1]
        + self.ACoeff[3]*self.E[:,:,6:  ]
        - self.ACoeff[1]*self.E[:,:,2:-4]
        - self.ACoeff[2]*self.E[:,:,1:-5]
        - self.ACoeff[3]*self.E[:,:, :-6]
    ...
```

Flux calculation in __Rust__ code
```rust
fn spatial_discretization (dom: &mut Domain) -> String {
    let message: String = format!("calculate flux");
    ...
    dom.fielddata[ii+_dq] =
          dom.fielddata[ii-3+_eflux] *acoeff_array[0]
        + dom.fielddata[ii-2+_eflux] *acoeff_array[1]
        + dom.fielddata[ii-1+_eflux] *acoeff_array[2]
        + dom.fielddata[ii+1+_eflux] *acoeff_array[3]
        + dom.fielddata[ii+2+_eflux] *acoeff_array[4]
        + dom.fielddata[ii+3+_eflux] *acoeff_array[5];
    ...
```
The __Python__ code has no implementation of Residual calculation at the end of time integration. Nevertheless, the runtime is 2 times longer than that of __Rust__. But, to get the same result __Rust__ consumes a lot of code lines in the current raw source. Using `ndarray` it could be enhanced in the main project.
