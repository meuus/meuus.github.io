Scientific computation using [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/ "Rust Programming Language") functional

The [original article](https://greenlab.di.uminho.pt/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/sleFinal.pdf?utm_source=thenewstack&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=platform) presented a comprehensive result by using 27 programming languages which are used in the contemporaries. The carefully monitoring showed how much electricity each one used â€” as well as its speed and memory usage.

More interestingly the article is dealing with the issues like:

* A faster language is always the most energy efficient?
* Is faster greener?
* The pros of compiled languages.

It is worth to address new results which could be available in the year 2021.

* Comparison in energy consumption

  |Language   |Energy consumed    |Run-time|
  |-------|---:|------:|
  |C      |57J |2019 ms|
  |Rust   |59J |2103 ms|
  |C++    |77J |3155 ms|
  |Ada    |98J |3740 ms|
  |Java   |114J|3821 ms|

* Comparison in memory requirement

  |Language   |Memory space needed|
  |-----------|-------------:|
  |Pascal     |66Mb|
  |Go         |69Mb|
  |C          |77Mb|
  |Fortran    |82Mb|
  |C++        |88Mb|

* Comparison in the different paradigms

  |Language | Energy consumed |Run-time|
  |----------|-------------:|------:|
  |Imperative         |125J   |5585ms|
  |Object-Oriented    |879J   |32965ms|
  |Functional         |1367J  |42740ms|
  |Scripting          |2320J  |88322ms|
