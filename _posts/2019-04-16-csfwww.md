Cerebrospinal fluid ([CSF][csfwiki]) dynamics in the human central nerve system
(CNS) is an extremely interesting topic in bio-fluid mechanics.
The disorders of the CNS components disrupt the CSF pulsatility
which is involved in a number of vital functions. The CFD analysis can
be used to quantify the functional interactions of the CNS member. The
numerical simulations of CSF filled in brain ventricles and
[subarachnoid spaces][saswiki] (SAS) are performed to build up a basis for
testing and optimizing the CNS therapeutics via understanding of the
CSF pathophysiology. In this post a recent collaboration of the
[SimLab - Highly Scalable Fluids and Solids Engineering](https://www.jara.org/de/forschung/center-for-simulation-and-data-sciences/simulation-laboratories/highly-scalable-fluids-and-solids-engineering "SLFSE at JSC")
at the [J&uuml;lich Supercomputing Centre][jsc-link]
with [Korea University Medical Center][kumc-link] is presented.

## What is the CSF?

The CSF surrounds a brain and a spinal cord such
that the CSF fills the cerebral ventricles as well as the cranial and
SAS. Not only the mechanical protection
for the central nerve system, the CSF transports
nutrients, neuroendocrine substances, and the removal of toxic
metabolites to preserve the chemical environment of the
brain ([Linninger et al. 2016][Linninger2016]). The fluid dynamic properties, e.g.,
density and viscosity, are close to water. Several prominent disease
states represent disorder of the CSF dynamics which includes an
increased intracranial pressure (ICP) by hydrocephalus
([Bal&eacute;dent et al. 2004][Baledent2004]) and decreases in the flow and
pulsatility by Chiari malformations ([Armonda et al. 1994][Armonda1994]). Under the
abnormal CSF conditions, although various symptoms can occur, the
specific etiologies are hardly understood to identify the
biomechanical interactions between the components of the CNS.

The CSF flow pulsates through two lateral ventricles which are
connected with the third ventricle. A thin channel, i.e., the aqueduct
of Sylvius, communicates with the third and the fourth ventricle. The
CSF from the fourth ventricle is transferred to the cranial and spinal
SAS. The clinical decision-making is difficult when the symptom occurs
with no disease characteristics, e.g., normal pressure
hydrocephalus. The recent studies have been oriented to develop
automated algorithms detecting the changes in the ventricle
system ([Ambarki et al. 2012][Ambarki2012], [Saele et al. 2015][Saele2015]).

In clinical applications the CSF circulation models consider the
pressure dynamics and the dynamics of CSF flow and cerebral blood
flow. The quantitative assessment provides robust evidences in judging
a patient care when the clinical parameters are subtle and
ambiguous ([Czosnyka et al. 2011][Czosnyka2011], [Linninger et al. 2016][Linninger2016]). The mechanical CSF model
is based on the fundamental conservation law of mass, momentum, and
chemical reactions ([Gupta et al. 2010][Gupta2010], [Tangen et al. 2015][Tangen2015], [Khani et al. 2018][Khani2018]). The
approaches using CFD can simulate
realistic CSF flows to predict the patient-specific scenarios. The
present study aims to establish a basis to test and optimize a
clinical therapy via the anatomically accurate simulation based on a
robust numerical procedure.

The three-dimensional images obtained by magnetic resonance imaging
(MRI) measurement provide the structures of ventricles and the SAS.
For a normal healthy human the CSF speed ranges in several
centimeters per second. The typical _Reynolds_ number is in the order
of \$\mathcal{O}(10^2)\$. However, the physiological mechanisms of the
CSF circulation develop vortical flow structures which exhibit a
turbulent-like motion induced by the difference in systolic and
diastolic velocities and the interactions of micro-structures with
fluids ([Tangen et al. 2015][Tangen2015], [Khani et al. 2018][Khani2018]).
Furthermore, to resolve the
micro-structures, like nerve roots and trabeculae, a short spinal
segment already demands a significant increase of the computational
cost ([Tangen et al. 2015][Tangen2015]). 

## Why do I need HPC to understand CSF dynamics?

At a first glance it seems strange to apply a high-performance computing
technique to a low _Reynolds_ number flow, i.e., the flow in
the human brain ventricles moves at very slow speeds less than dozens of centimeters
per second. However, to achieve a therapeutic basis, the complex
anatomical geometries as well as the CSF pulsatility require
spatially and temporarily high-resolution computations based on the
high-performance computing (HPC) technique. In the detailed tasks, the
numerical solutions of transitional phases, which are formulated based on
literature ([Czosnyka et al. 2011][Czosnyka2011], 
[Stadlbauer et al. 2010][Stadlbauer2010]), must be validated on the
quantitative assessment. The impact of the pulsatile flow parameters
on CSF dynamics is investigated in detail such that the
fundamental findings can be applied to physiological and engineering
problems.

## Where am I heading?

The outcomes have potential to be expanded in
various areas within fluid mechanics and the numerical models of
CNS. The quantitatively validated model can enable an optimized CSF
therapeutics to realize the more rapid application for efficient
clinical usage and the reduced cost for experiments. Together with the
clinical researches of CSF flow, the high-resolution CFD analysis
could lead to a better understanding of the pathophysiological basis
of a number of diseases with dysfunction of CSF flow, e.g., normal
pressure hydrocephalus and Alzheimer's diseases.

### Program 1 - CNS geometry impact on steady-streaming

The numerical simulation uses the brain ventricles and the cranial
SAS geometry extracted from an MRI measurement to build up the basis
of CSF modeling works. To support the project workflow, the flow
visualization and the graphical data-manipulation tools are required.
The CSF motion is analyzed at the steady-streaming condition
which is closely related with the geometry of brain ventricular system
connected to the cranial and the spinal SAS. At the beginning an
isolated ventricular system is considered with the median aperture
which drains the CSF from the fourth ventricle to SAS. Then the spinal
SAS is also included to compute the impact of geometry variations on the
flow field. The volume flow and the pressure distribution will be
determined at the systolic and the diastolic phases. The hypothesized
high-pressure distributions are configured to understand the CSF
dynamics in abnormal conditions. The quantitative assessment includes
the trade-off between accuracy and computational efficiency achieved
by coarser meshes.

### Program 2 - CSF dynamics at pulsatile conditions

Based on the flow parameters used in the steady-streaming condition, a
pulsatile flow inside the ventricular system can be configured to
mimic the physiological reality more closely. In this sub-project, the
impact of pulsatile flows on the CSF dynamics is studied with varying pulsation
frequencies. The spectral components are correlated with the flow
instabilities which trigger the turbulence transition in the
ventricles and SAS. The geometries of the spinal SAS as well as the
ventricles are required to predict the CSF flow field in a healthy and a
dysfunctional CNS. Due to the unsteady pulsatility and the large CSF
spaces, the computational cost is significantly increased for a
high-resolution numerical simulation. The quantitative assessment
includes the trade-off between accuracy and computational efficiency
achieved by coarser meshes.
